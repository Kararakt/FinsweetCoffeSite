          Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and
          sometimes we are unsure about how to<br />
          get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta
          Design wanted to build a Figma plugin<br />
          for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost
          UXWriter and has a set of UX copies<br />
          cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from
          plain, casual to playful. The<br />
          intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog
          post, â€˜Designing voice and tone for<br />
          error messages.
